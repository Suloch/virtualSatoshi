An attempt to make it possible for everyone to be able to communicate to pikachus. 	(◕‿◕)

## Idea (⊃｡•́‿•̀｡)⊃━✿✿✿✿✿✿
Make a compiler to generate code in pikachu language(contains only pi, pika, pikachu) from    
human understable code

## Plan  (¬‿¬ )
1. Create a virtual machine with minimal instrustion set(for sake of simplicity) to emulate
pikachu. Of course, it is a pikachu, that's why it will on base 3(because they can understand 3 words)
number system rather 2.

2. Create an assembly syntax for the emulated pikachu

3. Make a compiler to generate assembly from human friendly code
